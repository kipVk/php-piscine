Day of 42 game page (copying exactly the image given using photoshop to measure). The assignment asks to use all the images, which includes the reference one. Now, I am assuming what was asked is to use the reference as a background and position all the elements on top of it. Since I am not evaluating this day00 and I believe this instruction is pure torture, I won't redo the exercise just for that. I'd rather move on with the learning.
