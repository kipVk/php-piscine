<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix representation and operation with matrix and vectors. It expects an
array with these keys:

- ’preset’: the matrix type to, mandatory. The value must be one of the Class
	constants previoulsy defined.
- ’scale’: the scale factor, mandatory when 'preset' is worth SCALE.
- ’angle’: the rotation angle in radians, mandatory when 'preset' is worth RX,
	RY or RZ.
- ’vtc’: translation vector, mandatory when 'preset' is worth TRANSLATION.
- ’fov’: projection field of view in degrees mandatory when
- 'preset' is worth PROJECTION.
- ’ratio’: projected image ratio, mandatory when 'preset' is worth PROJECTION.
- ’near’: projection’s near clipping plane mandatory when 'preset' is worth
	PROJECTION.
- ’far’: projection’s far clipping plane mandatory when 'preset' is worth
	PROJECTION.

The array needs to define a preset from: IDENTITY, SCALE, RX, RY, RZ, 
TRANSLATION and PROJECTION.

Depending on the selected preset, the other keys need to have values as
described above.

Verbose available as Matrix::verbose

It contains the following public methods:
- doc(): shows documentation
- Matrix mult(Matrix $rhs): returns the multiplication of both matrices.
- Vertex transformVertex(Vertex $vtx): returns a new vertex resulting from
	the tranformation of the vertex by the matrix.
- Matrix transpose(): Returns the transposed matrix, performing a diagonal
	symetry. X become Y in the array and viceversa.
