<- Render ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Render images according to 3 modes: Vertex, Edge, Raster.
The resulted image is a png file.

The Render class constructor is expecting an array with the following keys:
- ’width’: The generated image’s width, which is mandatory.
- ’height’: The generated image’s height which is mandatory.
- ’filename’: Filename in which the png image created will be
	saved, which is mandatory.

It has 3 constants, VERTEX, EDGE and RASTERIZE, used to select the mode.

Verbose is available with Render::verbose

It contains the following public methods:

- void renderVertex( Vertex $screenVertex ) : Displays a ”screen” coordinates
	vertex in the generated image (a pixel basically).
- void renderTriangle( Triangle $triangle, $mode ) : Displays a ”screen”
	coordinates triangle in the generated image according to the selected mode. The mode must be one of the
	previoulsy defined Class constants.
- void develop() : Save the png generated image on the hard drive using the
	filename given to the constructor.
- renderMesh($array, $mode): Gets an array of triangles and applies the render mode
	parsed.
- renderEdge (Vertex $a, Vertex $b): given two vertices it will draw the line
	between them
